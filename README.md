*NOTE: This will replace the chosen client with DreamBot. If you want to use either one again, you will need to reinstall it.



## How to use
1. Download the latest release from [here]()
2. Extract both files into the same folder
3. Open `db-launcher-tool.jar`
4. Set your settings, and click `Replace launcher`.
